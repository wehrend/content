An analog modular synthesizer was ever me dream, last week I fulfilled this dream of mine,
and ordered the pocket operator modular 400 from the swedish company teenage engineering.
Like  furniture from the other popular swedish company you first have to build it yourself,
before making any sound with it. This took me around 3 to 4 hours. But it was worth it.

Here are some patch ideas.

(I apology for the bad video quality and bad sound quality, the setup
will be improved.) The nice thing about modular synthesizer ist that they break
the traditional signal path of voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), voltage controlled filter (VCF) and voltage controlled amplifier (VCA),
and allow for all the creativity to culminate in experimental setups.

With the random module we can sample & hold a signal from the input. Its companionship is the noise module.
We feed the saw output to the input of the rand module.
